BIG COMMIT

--> /agnpy/photomeson:
    photomeson and kelner folder, there is a README inside that explains a bit the additional scripts
    Also there is a copy of the main photomeson script with detailed documentation

--> /agnpy/tests/test_kelner.py:
    I used it to create some plots (for agnpy vs reference, not with the blob). I added a plot function in the tests/utils.py
    in order to plot them. In order for it to works, the folder "data" with the reference seds need to be
    a folder more out than where it is now, this has to be fixed.

--> /agnpy/tesi:
    this folder is a bit of a casino, still has to be organized

--> /agnpy/data:
    I added the reference spectra of kelner aharonian 2008
    I also added the correct interpolation tables
